# From PPO to GRPO — A Beginner Guide

*A readable, step-by-step tutorial that takes newcomers from Reinforcement Learning (RL) basics to PPO and then to GRPO.  
This repository is **documentation only** (text and figures). No runtime environment or training code is provided.*

---

## Who This Is For
- Students and practitioners who want a **conceptual first pass** before touching code.
- Readers who prefer **structured notes** with clear motivation, diagrams, and references.

## What You Will Learn
- RL foundations (MDP, policy/value, actor–critic).
- PPO core ideas: importance sampling, trust-region intuition with **clipping**, **GAE**, and the **full training loop**, plus strengths and limitations.
- GRPO motivation and mechanism: **group-relative advantage**, training workflow, typical results, and when it helps.
- A code-level walkthrough (at a high level) of open-source implementations such as **TRL**, alongside clear pseudocode to connect math to practice.

## How to Read This Tutorial
- Start at **1. RL Basics**, then proceed in order.  
- Sections are concise and build on each other; use the numbered headings as a roadmap.  
- If you want runnable examples, see external libraries (e.g., TRL) or future companion repos—this one focuses on **understanding**.

## Table of Contents

1. **RL Basics**  
   1.1 What is RL?  
   1.2 Core Concepts (MDP / policy / value / advantage)  
   1.3 Policy Gradient (background / derivation / REINFORCE / limitations)  
   1.4 Actor–Critic

2. **PPO Core Principles**

   2.2 Trust Region Intuition & the **Clip** objective  
   2.3 **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**  
   2.4 **End-to-End Training Process** (sampling → advantage → mini-batch updates → monitoring)  
   2.5 Strengths and Limitations of PPO

3. **GRPO Core Principles**  
   3.1 Background and Motivation  
   3.2 The Core Mechanism (group-relative advantages, zero-mean constraint, optional KL to a reference policy)  
   3.3 Training Workflow (group sampling → scoring/ranking → constructing relative advantages → update)  
   3.4 Strengths and Representative Results
